After executing 

> make

inside the src/ directory, an executable file named "pn.x" should appear here. 
If not already done, add this folder to your PATH by including the following line to your .bashrc file:

export PATH=$HOME/bin:PATH_TO_YOUR_Simphony_INSTALLATION/bin:$PATH

and with that you should be ready to go.

We have also added two simple scripts to generate the input files for Simphony by reading a QuantumESPRESSO output.

Thank you for using Simphony!
